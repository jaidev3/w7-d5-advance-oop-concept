K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN) Working Principle:

KNN is a simple, instance-based learning algorithm. It classifies a data point based on the majority label of its K-nearest neighbors in the feature space. The distance between data points is calculated using distance metrics like Euclidean distance.

Best Suited For: It is effective for classification and regression tasks, especially for problems with clear decision boundaries and when you have a small dataset. It performs well for problems with low-dimensional feature spaces.

Common Distance Metrics in KNN:

Euclidean Distance: Most commonly used; it measures the straight-line distance between two points.

Manhattan Distance: Measures the sum of the absolute differences between two points.

Minkowski Distance: Generalized distance metric that includes both Euclidean and Manhattan as special cases.

Cosine Similarity: Measures the cosine of the angle between two vectors, often used in text analysis.

Advantages and Limitations of KNN:

Advantages:

Simple and intuitive.

Non-parametric (does not assume a specific distribution of the data).

Suitable for multi-class problems.

Limitations:

Computationally expensive for large datasets.

Sensitive to irrelevant features.

Requires feature scaling for accurate results.

Bayes' Theorem:

Bayes' Theorem gives the probability of a hypothesis (class label) based on prior knowledge and the likelihood of the evidence.

Formula:

In Naive Bayes, this theorem is used to predict class labels by calculating the posterior probability of a class given the features of a data point.

Naive Assumption in Naive Bayes:

"Naive" refers to the assumption that features are conditionally independent given the class label. This assumption simplifies the computation but may not hold true in real-world data.

Significance: Despite being a strong assumption, Naive Bayes often performs well in practice, particularly in text classification tasks.

Comparison of Gaussian, Multinomial, and Bernoulli Naive Bayes:

Gaussian Naive Bayes: Assumes that the features follow a normal distribution. Suitable for continuous features.

Multinomial Naive Bayes: Works well for discrete data and is widely used for document classification with text features (e.g., word counts).

Bernoulli Naive Bayes: Suitable for binary features (presence or absence of a feature). Often used in binary classification problems.

Real-World Use Cases:

Gaussian: Predicting medical outcomes based on continuous variables.

Multinomial: Classifying text documents based on word frequencies.

Bernoulli: Spam classification (presence/absence of certain words).

Differences Between KNN and Naive Bayes:

Model Type: KNN is an instance-based learning method, while Naive Bayes is a probabilistic model.

Assumptions: KNN does not assume anything about the data distribution, while Naive Bayes assumes independence between features.
